Hi, I am Thanos. I am an aerospace engineer and this blog serves as a journal for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) cases, data science or anything else that comes to my mind.

Validation and Verification in CFD is of paramount importance and what we see normally in the internet are nice images that make us think that CFD stands for Colorful Fluid Dynamics. My goal is to create and share a few validation cases in CFD and at the same time, showcase beautiful images. If you have any comment regarding what you see in this page, email me at [thanos@poulos.org](mailto:thanos@poulos.org).
