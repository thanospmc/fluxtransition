Title: About
Author: Thanos Poulos

This is a journal for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) cases and data science. Validation and Verification in CFD is of paramount importance and what we see normally in the internet are nice images that make us think that CFD stands for Colorful Fluid Dynamics. My goal is to create and share a few validation cases in CFD and at the same time, showcase beautiful images. At the same time, I will journal my dabblings with data, python and whatever comes to mind.
